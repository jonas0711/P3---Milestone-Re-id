\chapter{Results} \label{cha: results}\chapter{Results} \label{cha: results}

This chapter presents the final evaluation results for all trained models. The models were tested both in-distribution on standard \ac{ReID} benchmarks and out-of-distribution using the conditions described in Section \ref{sec: oodtestny}.

\section{Super-Resolution Results}
\label{sec:sr_test_results}

The \ac{SR} models were evaluated on the RELLISUR NLHR test set, which consists of 85 native low-resolution images. This test set represents a realistic out-of-distribution scenario, as the models were trained on cropped image pairs but evaluated on full native low-resolution images. Table \ref{tab:sr_test_results} summarizes the results.

\end{table}
\noindent The \ac{EDSR} model trained on RELLISUR and finetuned on \ac{DIV2K} achieved the best overall performance with an average \ac{PSNR} of 33.30 dB and \ac{SSIM} of 0.970. The model trained only on RELLISUR achieved 31.77 dB and 0.962 respectively. The 1.53 dB difference represents a meaningful improvement in reconstruction quality.
\\\\
The performance difference between in-distribution validation and out-of-distribution testing was notable. While the scratch model achieved higher validation \ac{PSNR} during training, the \ac{DIV2K}-finetuned model substantially outperformed on the test set. This indicated that the diversity of the \ac{DIV2K} dataset provided the finetuned model with better generalization capabilities for native low-resolution images.
\\\\
The pretrained SwinIR models performed considerably worse without domain-specific finetuning. SwinIR Classic achieved 27.23 dB, which is 6.07 dB lower than the best \ac{EDSR} model. SwinIR Real Large failed entirely with a \ac{PSNR} of 13.19 dB and \ac{SSIM} of 0.042, producing severe artifacts due to a mismatch between expected and actual input characteristics.
\\\\
Based on these results, the \ac{EDSR} \ac{DIV2K}-finetuned model was selected for integration with the \ac{ReID} pipeline.

\section{ReID Results}

The \ac{ReID} models were evaluated both in-distribution on standard benchmarks and out-of-distribution using the degradation conditions described in Table \ref{tab:newood_conditions}.

\subsection{In-Distribution Performance}

Table \ref{tab:reid_indist} presents the in-distribution performance of all model configurations on the MSMT17, Market-1501, and CUHK03 datasets.

\subsection{Out-of-Distribution Performance}

The models are not only tested and evaluated using the OOD test, but also tested on the dataset in distribution, in order to determine how the models is in general.
