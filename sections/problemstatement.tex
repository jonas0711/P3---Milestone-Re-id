\chapter{Problem Statement} \label{cha: problemstatement}

Based on the findings in the problem analysis in Chapter \ref{cha:problemanalysis} and technical analysis in Chapter \ref{cha: technicalanalysis}, the following problem statement can be formulated:
\\\\
\textit{"How can a person Re-identification system be designed to improve performance through combinations with super-resolution?"}
\\\\
In the curriculum for this project, it is stated that the model has to be deployed. For that reason an extra problem statement are added.
\\\\
\textit{"How can the system be implemented and deployed as a proof-of-concept?"}


% How can a cloud-based Re-ID system be improved by integrating a super resolution model?
