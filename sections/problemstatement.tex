\chapter{Problem Statement} \label{cha: problemstatement}

Based on the findings in the problem analysis in Chapter \ref{cha:problemanalysis}, it is evident that a person re-identification system can be a valuable tool for society, if designed correctly: Ethical considerations must be made, and the system should be trustworthy for deployment.
The technical analysis in Chapter \ref{cha: technicalanalysis}, provides an insight into the limitations caused by hardware and environment, as well as the challenges in the task of person re-identification. The related works out-of-distribution test highlights the potential for further work on the subject. Based on these findings, the problem statement is formulated as follows:
\\\\
\textit{"How can a person Re-identification system be designed and deployed as a proof-of-concept, to improve performance through combinations with super-resolution?"}

% How can a cloud-based Re-ID system be improved by integrating a super resolution model?
