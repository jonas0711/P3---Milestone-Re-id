\section{Milestone Systems}\label{sec:milestone}
Milestone Systems is a global provider of video surveillance software, headquartered in Brøndby, Denmark. The company portfolio consists of the video management software XProtect VMS, the video surveillance service Arcules, and the analytics platform BriefCam. BriefCam integrates seamlessly with XProtect and is presented by Milestone as the advanced video-analytics layer for rapid video review, real-time alerts, and deeper research or forensics \cite{MilestoneSystems2025}. Of particular relevance to this report, BriefCam provides person \ac{ReID} via two complementary approaches, being face-based matching using operator-validated watchlists and appearance-similarity search that links visually similar individuals across non-overlapping cameras based on visual features and attributes \cite{MilestoneSystems2025}.
